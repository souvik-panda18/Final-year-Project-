# üß† NNPID-Controlled Line Follower Pick-and-Place Robot ü§ñ

## üìå Overview

This project implements a smart **Line Follower Robot** integrated with a **pick-and-place manipulator**, powered by a **Neural Network-based PID (NNPID) controller**. The system dynamically adjusts its PID gains (`Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`) using a trained neural network to achieve optimal performance in varying conditions, such as line curvature, speed variations, and load imbalances.

The manipulator arm is equipped with **3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**:
- Vertical movement (up/down)
- Horizontal movement (forward/backward)
- 360¬∞ base rotation

The robot is designed to navigate predefined paths, pick up objects using servo-actuated grippers, and place them at target zones autonomously.

## üéØ Key Features

- üöó **Line Following**: Uses IR sensors to track black lines on a white surface.
- üéØ **Real-time PID Tuning**: Neural network predicts optimal PID parameters based on current and past error states.
- ü¶æ **3-DOF Pick-and-Place Arm**: Controlled via PWM signals and optimized via the NNPID model.
- üß† **Neural Network-Based Control**: Feedforward neural network predicts control gains dynamically, improving response and stability.
- üîß **Modular Design**: Clean separation of robot chassis control and manipulator logic.
- üìà **Adaptive Behavior**: Reacts to disturbances (e.g., path curvature or uneven weights) with improved stability.
